                        My journey as a graduate student started last fall, and there has been no looking back.
                        I've found my interest in HCI research and my previous experience in Software Development 
                        directed me towards research in software engineering as well. Only a few months into gradlife, 
                        I haven't yet published any of my work but you can check out the work I'm currently 
                        doing under the "Research" tab.</p>
